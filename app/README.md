# Insurance Calculator â€“ Interview Task

Analyze the attached code and refactor it with a strong OOP mindset, keeping in mind principles such as **extensibility, testability, and SOLID, etc.**.

Consider whether passing around plain strings is the best option or think about how new insurance types or add-ons could be introduced without modifying existing code.

You may restructure, rename, or redesign the solution as you see fit.  

If you have time, feel free to add **unit tests** to demonstrate how your refactored version could be tested.

Good luck!
